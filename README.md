#Company Home Page
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from CodeCademy

## Objective
The objective here is to create a fake company homepage using flexbox.

### Subject
I decided to create a page for a company called **"Chibreur Privé"**, a parody of **Chauffeur Privé**, which was a Uber-like French company.
Chibre in French means Dick. The idea was to create a prostitution website were women could order a male for sex.

The pictures are pics from my friends, and this is only intended for personnal sharing.
